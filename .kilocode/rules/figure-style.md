# Figure Style (JAMA)

When creating or editing any figure (matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot2, etc.), enforce these rules:

- **Font**: Arial, minimum 8pt for ALL text (no exceptions)
- **No text overlap**: Titles, legends, footnotes, axis labels, and cell annotations must not collide
- **Legends**: Must NOT block data — place outside the plot area (below figure, beside panels, or in whitespace)
- **Axis labels**: Sentence case, JAMA format (e.g., "Respondents, %" not "% Endorsing")
- **Font sizes**:
  - Titles: 10-12pt bold
  - Axis labels: 9-10pt
  - Tick labels: 8-9pt
  - Annotations/legends/footnotes: 8pt minimum
- **Verification**: After generating a figure, visually inspect the output image to verify no overlap or blocked data
